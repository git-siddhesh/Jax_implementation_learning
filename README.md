try to solve some of the problems given in the documentation


# Questions that need to be addressed

- What is normal distribution
- What is univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- what is bivariate normal distribution
- Marginal PDF

# Tools to be used

- Python
- JAX library
- matplotlib
- numpy


# univariate vs bivariate analysis

Univariate: Using only one class of feature for generating the output

`y = theta1*x + theta2`

Where thetas are weight and bias

Bivariate: Using two different class of features for generating the output 

`z = theta1*x + theta2*y + theta3`

> This multivariate analysis help us to find the correlation between the features

# Normal distribution
